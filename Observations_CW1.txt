Observation of the two speed cases for the airfoil in the Aeroelastic simulation - MATLAB CW Pt1 

When v = 9.5 m/s:
The range of variation for both pitch and heave was between -0.1 and 0.1 degrees and towards the end of the 45 seconds, both graphs converged to 0 degrees. 
This is because at lower freestream velocities, the pitch and heave of the airfoil are less strong as the airfoil experiences less lift and drag forces.

When v = 12.0 m/s:
Similarly, the pitch against time plot also varied within the range of -0.1 to 0.1 degrees however it diverged towards the end of 45 seconds.
This divergence is the same for the heave against time plot but the variation of the range of heave started off greater between -0.2 and 0.2 degrees.
Towards the end of the 45 seconds, the heave was around -0.4 degrees and the pitch was starting to diverge to values slightly less than -0.1 degrees.
